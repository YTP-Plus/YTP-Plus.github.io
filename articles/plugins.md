# Plugin Releases

These are released plugins that are verified to work with ytp+ cli as effects.

Plugins for ytp+ infinity must copy the source video rather than renaming them as this will break repeating old clips in the case of long generation time.

Submit plugins at [ytp+ hub](https://discord.gg/8ppmspR6Wh) for manual review.

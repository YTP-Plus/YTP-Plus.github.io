# Plugin Releases

These are released plugins that are verified to work with ytp+ cli as effects.

Plugins for ytp+ infinity must copy the source video rather than renaming them as this will break repeating old clips in the case of long generation time.

Submit plugins at [ytp+ hub](https://discord.gg/8ppmspR6Wh) for manual review.

## Official

* [squidward.js](https://ytp-plus.github.io/plugins/squidward-v1.0.1.zip) v1.0.2
    * Replicates the 'Squidward fad' meme as an effect - a relic from YTP past.
    * Requires ytp+ cli v0.3.4 and ImageMagick (see included README.txt).
    * Not supported in ytp+ infinity (causes desync issues).
    * Created by [TeamPopplio](https://github.com/TeamPopplio/).
